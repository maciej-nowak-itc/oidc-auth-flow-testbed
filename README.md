# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the server mode.\
Express serving the React App, be sure to build React app first.\
Default port 5000, e.g. http://localhost:5000

### `npm run dev start`

Runs the app in the dev mode for both frontend and backend. Hot swap code working for both sides.\
Backend running on port 5000.\
Frontend running on port 3000.\
React proxy set to http://localhost:5000 \
If you want to hotswap React, be sure to start on 3000, otherwise... be sure to run `npm run build` first.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.\
Sorry. No tests so far.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
